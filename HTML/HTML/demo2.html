    GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).[17] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive. (i.e Individual or groups of company executive leaders makes decision on project aims and development including funding)[18]

    GitHub.com was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[20] In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital.[6] In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million of venture capital in a series B round. Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and other venture capital funds.[21] As of 2023, GitHub was estimated to be generating $1 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue.[1] The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P.
