    in the rapidly growing digital economy. Kumar, who had worked in the IT industry for over a decade, realized that there was a significant gap 
    between the skills required by the industry and the skills possessed by professionals.[2]
    The company started as a blog where Kumar shared his knowledge and expertise with a small community of learners.
